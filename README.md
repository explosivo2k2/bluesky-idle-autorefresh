# Twitter Idle AutoRefresh

A Mozilla Firefox add-on that automatically reveals unread tweets every set seconds on Bluesky feeds feeds, so long as the customisable conditions are met. The primary goal of this add-on is to allow you to continiously read Bluesky whilst doing other things on the side (e.g. work).

You may find a handful of options (including but not limited to the customisable conditions for the auto-refreshing procedure) through the Mozilla Firefox add-on's page (`about:addons`).
